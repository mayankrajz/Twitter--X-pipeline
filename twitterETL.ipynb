In a special way, I want to thank @RockefellerFdn and @TEDTalks for making this possible.   We’re discussing the “intersection between war and climate change.” I know dark clouds of war and poverty have been thick over Africa. We have to beam the light of peace for Africans who are battling the devastating effects of Climate Change.   When we look ahead, work together with positivity, it won’t be long before peace returns to Africa. We want war to end - in DR Congo, Sudan, everywhere in Africa and the world. We want refugees to return home.  To our iconic youth of Africa, you’re the present and future heros with unmatched skills. Stand up to end poverty. Be the household names in the fight against Climate Change. Bring precision and strength in building peace. The distance of our journey and sacrifice means our love for Africa never fades, embrace and hold on it.
